# Roll Planner Vision & Mission

## Mission

To help film photographers make confident, intentional decisions about their film stock before every shoot, reducing decision paralysis and encouraging creative commitment.

---

## Vision

Roll Planner reimagines the film selection process as a deliberate, almost ritualistic act. In a world of infinite digital captures and endless post-processing options, shooting film demands commitment. You choose your stock, load your roll, and live with that decision for 24 or 36 frames.

We believe this constraint is a feature, not a limitation.

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Commitment Over Options

Film photography is about embracing constraints. Roll Planner doesn't overwhelm you with every film stock ever made. It gives you one clear recommendation based on your conditions and intent, encouraging you to commit and shoot.

### 2. Science Meets Intuition

The recommendation algorithm is built on technical film characteristics (grain structure, latitude, color science) combined with real-world shooting wisdom. It's not about finding the "best" film - it's about finding the right film for this specific moment.

### 3. Presence Over Perfection

The discipline reminders ("Slow down. Wait for stillness." or "Stay present. Don't chase moments.") are designed to shift focus from technical perfection to mindful presence. The best photographs come from being fully engaged with your subject, not obsessing over settings.

### 4. Tools, Not Toys

The interface is designed like a precision instrument - a tool you pick up, use with intention, and put down. No gamification, no social features, no endless scrolling. Just functional beauty in service of a clear purpose.

## Design Philosophy

### The Machined Metal Aesthetic

Roll Planner draws inspiration from:

- **Teenage Engineering OP-1:** Playful precision, tactile interfaces, joyful functionality
- **Leica M cameras:** Timeless simplicity, purposeful restraint
- **Braun design (Dieter Rams):** "Less, but better"
- **Scientific instruments:** Honest materials, clear readouts, functional beauty

The brushed aluminum texture, precise typography, and subtle LED-style indicators create a sense of quality and permanence. This isn't a disposable app - it's a tool worthy of the craft it serves.

### Orange as Signal

The orange accent color (`#ff9500`) is used sparingly and with purpose:

- It indicates active, selected, or interactive states
- It guides attention to what matters right now
- It never decorates - it always communicates

This restraint makes each orange element meaningful. When something glows orange, it demands your attention.

## Target User

Roll Planner is for photographers who:

- Shoot film intentionally, not nostalgically
- Value the constraint of committing to a single stock
- Want to spend less time deciding and more time shooting
- Appreciate tools that respect their intelligence
- Understand that limitations breed creativity

---

## What Roll Planner Is Not

- **A film database:** We don't list every film ever made. We recommend what works.
- **A social platform:** No sharing, no likes, no followers. Just you and your work.
- **A light meter app:** We provide guidance, not precision measurements. Bring your own meter.
- **A replacement for experience:** The algorithm is a starting point. Your eye is the final word.

## Success Metrics

Roll Planner succeeds when photographers:

1. Feel confident locking in a roll before leaving the house
2. Spend more time shooting and less time second-guessing
3. Build intuition about film characteristics over time
4. Return to the app before each new roll, not just once

## Closing Thought

> "The best camera is the one you have with you."

We extend this wisdom to film:

> "The best film is the one you commit to."
